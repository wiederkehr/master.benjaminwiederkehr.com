Visual representation of financial information can help people to analyze their earning, spending and saving behavior by identifying recurring patterns and emerging trends. Understanding and validating the output of such a representation is a task that requires visualization literacy that highly depends on the configuration of content and the presentation of the data. Furthermore, the user's context and capabilities define how the presented information can be transformed into applied knowledge that is required to facilitate sensible planning and informed decisions. 

In this thesis, design considerations will be offered that support the interpretation and the utilization of personal financial information for users. These considerations derive from the development and evaluation of an instrument for accessing and handling personal financial information and a preliminary review of existing solutions. The taken approach will be validated during user tests of a series of prototypes and it will be reported how the affordances of the prototypes were perceived in specific use cases. Based on the findings from this work, a set of design recommendations for interactive visual analysis tools that support an intuitively accessible, memorable and actionable comprehension will be distilled.
