Gaining insights and making decisions from financial information requires for most people to collaborate with an intermediary such as a financial advisor which potentially deprives people from self-determination. The access to transparent information is, due to its' complexity, not sufficient to foster a critical handling of financials and consequentially facilitate an independent capacity to act. The goal of this master thesis is to reduce this independancy by providing intuitive and accessible instruments that foster understanding through exploration and verification. I believe that it's the responsibility of our tools to adapt inaccessible things to our human limitations. Equipped with such adequate tools, people with inexistent or limited financial literacy will be able to conduct a more informed, considered, critical and trained interaction with money. As part of this work, I strive to answers the question, how the visual and functional design of an application for the exploration, evaluation and communication of personal financial data needs to be, to give the user access to the contained information. With a user centered design instead of a technology driven approach, a series of prototypes will be created that individually analyse subsections of a holistic system for the access and handling of personal financial information. Eventually, these applets will be combined into a functional instrument.
