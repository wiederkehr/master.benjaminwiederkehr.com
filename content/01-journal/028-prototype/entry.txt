In the fifth presentation, the focus lied on the prototypes for our experiments. Although I was busy building some examples of visualizations to analyze financial data, the outcome wasn't very satisfactorily just yet. Therefore, I only showed a few simple examples together with my conclusion that the visualizations need to be more sophisticated to really evaluate the impact of the interaction attributes as described (link: journal/interaction-attributes text:here).
