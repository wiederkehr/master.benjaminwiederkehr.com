During the observation the user will be asked to answer a set of questions by using the instrument. These are examples for basic question-driven activities with personal finances:

- How does a reduction of [a] impact my wealth?
- How does an increase in [b] impact my wealth?
- How would my liquidity look like in the case of [c]?
- Can I afford to buy [d]?
- When can I afford to increase my spending for [e]?
- How much do I spend for [f]?
- How do I have to change my spending to achieve [g]?
- If I didn't do [h], how would my wealth look like?

These types of activities can be abstracted into the sequence of **Question → Information → Answer** and can be seen as an alternative to the goal-driven activity as represented by the sequence **Goal → Tasks → Action** steps. The main difference is the focus on content in the question-driven sequence and focus on functionality in the goal-driven sequence.
