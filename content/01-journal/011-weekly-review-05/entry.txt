First up was (link:http://www.webofthings.org/team/ text:Dominique Guinard), co-founder and CTO of Evrthng, a platform and engine that helps companies set up an infrastructure for the internet of things. Second was (link:http://people.inf.ethz.ch/mkovatsc/ text:Matthias Kovatsch), researcher in the Institute for Pervasive Computing at ETHZ, talking about CoAP and his implementation of it in Copper. I was third and talked briefly about the work we do at Interactive Things and then described our process of data driven design for the (link:http://villevivante.ch/ text:Ville Vivante project).
