In short, I have decided to extend my work on the thesis by one year. I just didn't arrive where I wanted to be after 12 months. I realized how different the work on clients' projects is from the work on a research project and that I need to change the attitude towards this field more. I can't lie, this realization comes a bit late and with a some frustration. That said, I am much looking forward to the work ahead and so are my mentors.

Thanks and stick with me.
